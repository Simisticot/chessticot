This is a TUI chess game written in rust.
My hope is to one day use the chess logic to build one or more chess engines "from first principles".  
Currently:  
- All chess rules are implemented, with partial test coverage and likely bugs  
- The UI allows one to play a full game controlling both colors, from the terminal  
- Proof of concept engines are available, that play random moves and crash the program when no move is legal
- The UI is not very friendly
