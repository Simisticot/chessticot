# Chessticot
This is a TUI chess game written in rust.
The chess logic and engines are implemented in a different repo named "libchessticot" and shared with a web ui developped separately

## Current Advancement
- The UI allows you to pick a color and what engine to play against  
- Bishops are displayed as "Bishob", this is a feature.  

## Controls
- In main menu use left and right arrow keys to select your color, enter to confirm  
- In the game use arrow keys or hjkl to move the cursor and space to select a piece/confirm a move, escape to cancel a move, tab to change which piece you want to promote to  
- On all screens hit 'q' to quit
